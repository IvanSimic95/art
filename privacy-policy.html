<p>Collection of Information, Use of it and Communication with Parents</p>
<p></p>
<p>Children can investigate the site, and can view and print content without giving any individual data other than the automatic collection of device persistent identifiers, examined in more detail beneath. Our site just gathers limited individual data if the child registers to become a member or presents a question or request to us. In the event, the data gathered does not permit contact with him or her or his or her gadget (counting, for instance, collected data), we may utilize and uncover it for any reason, to the degree allowed by applicable law.</p>
<p>Registration Process</p>

<p>    Username (we advise the child not to use his or her real name);</p>
<p>    Password;</p>
<p>    Birth month and year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We additionally require the child to give a parent's email address. We utilize the parent's email address to look for parental consent for the child's enrollment and to clarify what data we are gathering, how we plan to utilize it, and how the parent can renounce consent or demand whenever that we expel the record and erase any individual data gathered from the child (counting the parental contact data).</p>
